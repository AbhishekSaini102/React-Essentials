## Introduction

React State Management Libraries aims to demystify state management in React by covering different libraries and patterns. Whether you're looking for simplicity with React's built-in state, global state management with Redux, context-based solutions with Context API, or modern solutions like Recoil, you'll find comprehensive explanations and practical examples here.

## Libraries Covered

### 1. React's Built-in State

- **Description**: Utilizing React's useState hook for local component state.
- **Examples**: Basic state management within functional components.

### 2. Redux

- **Description**: A predictable state container for managing global application state.
- **Examples**: Integration with Redux toolkit for efficient state management.

### 3. Context API

- **Description**: React's built-in solution for sharing state between components without prop drilling.
- **Examples**: Using context providers and consumers for application-wide state.

### 4. Recoil

- **Description**: Facebook's experimental state management library for React applications.
- **Examples**: State management with atoms, selectors, and useRecoilState hooks.
